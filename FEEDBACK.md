** Their feedback **

Unfortunately we won’t be moving to the next stage, here is the feedback that has been given:

They felt you took a deliberate and well considered approach to your solution to the problem, and showed something
functionally that worked. However the brief for solution stressed the desire to see a testable solution. They felt you
were worried about finishing the app instead of demonstrating your approach to writing product ready software. They
would have preferred to have seen you not complete the app, but include more testable interfaces or write some unit
tests to cover your DTO layer for example. Automated testing is key for our strategy and they need engineers to
demonstrate their understanding.

** My response **

There must be a misunderstanding. My code was testable. I specifically said during the interview that this is not how
I would normally start a project, and I removed abstractions to fit the demo within an hour. At the end I was given
five minutes to write a test, but it was impossible within the timeframe, given that the only testable feature required
file operations. I'm sorry to say, but this was a miserable experience. Unless it's a misunderstanding, I hope?

** Second feedback **

He felt this was the core of the issue. They cared more about you demonstrating a product quality codebase rather than
a finished project. They would have given higher marks for a half-finished project with a good quality test suite than
a finished project with no tests at all. David said when it became apparent you couldn’t finish the project in time, he
stopped you and suggested you maybe add a bit of coverage. You mentioned you didn’t have time, so they asked generally
how you would test it. Unfortunately, the answer was very general rather than specific to the things in your codebase
you would write tests for.

** My second response **

Thank you, that makes some sense. It seems I completely misunderstood the challenge here. But given that the brief
talked about shortcuts, I believe that's understandable. And on the follow-up question, I just gave the best answer I
could from an Android point of view, which is more complex than outsiders would think. I had the impression it was just
a spontaneous question. I would be glad to demonstrate what I can do in a follow-up interview, if that helps. I was
responsible for the whole test pyramid in my last job, so it would look silly to me if I failed on that topic.
