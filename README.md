The interview will be 90 minutes, however Iâ€™ve added the brief below so you can have a look at this in advance and have
some thinking time on this and maybe even practice. But just to confirm, you will be completing this in the actual
interview. Could you please send me your availability please so we can go ahead and get this booked in? Thank you!

Using the data at the URL listed below, design and build an API that will fetch all the books and display them in a
list. Treat this as if you were building a fully-fledged feature, so think about testability, time constraints, etc.
Walk us through how you think about building something like this and explain any shortcuts you're taking along the way.

Show the following pieces of information for each item:

Image
Title
Author
Reviews
The name of any other books the author has written.

Extra points

Download and cache images for reuse later. Explain your strategy before building.

Create a way for the user to favourite books and show those books in a separate tab in the application. Explain your
strategy before building.

What steps would you take to ensure that your app is performing as well as it can now and has no issues? Walk through
the process.
